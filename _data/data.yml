    details: |
      During my time at Bosch.IO in Berlin from September 2017 to February 2020, I worked in various roles including working student, intern, and thesis student, gaining comprehensive experience in software development and applied research. As part of an agile development team in the energy sector, I contributed to the creation of a cloud-based process automation system for the rollout of modern metering infrastructure, using technologies such as Java and Python. In my internship, I supported the implementation of information security processes based on the BSI IT-Grundschutz standards. My Bachelor's thesis, titled “Forecasting the electricity demand of a production plant using machine learning,” focused on data engineering and the use of TensorFlow to develop predictive models. Additionally, I participated in outreach activities as a trainer for Kids Hackathons, helping to foster interest in coding and technology among young learners. This period provided me with valuable experience in both technical implementation and interdisciplinary collaboration within a real-world industrial context.
